        <h1>Thanks To My Mentor And Professor Doctor Amany</h1>
        <p>
            I am very grateful to Dr. Amany for allowing me to learn and grow in this field
            and for allowing me to Perform this project As I See fit Without bounding my Imagination 
            as some people in life are simply kind beyond words and she is one of them 
            also very rarely you would find someone that gives in genuine time and thought of your ideas 
            but she broke that rule as a professor she didn't simply give me the best answer in fact 
            she waited for me to give her the best answer I could think of which opened my eyes to her core teaching 
            method and how I was inspired by her to change my way of learning, in every great person you will find arrogance or pride 
            but she wasn't like that she didn't look me down because of my very finite knowledge instead she gave me a push forward 
            and a new perspective to learning from and that is what I am looking forward to in the future
            from I am a Student who Doesn't Forget a Good Teacher I Will Never Forget You Dr.Amany
